## Welcome

Junior software developer. I love making web apps that rock your world.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to join front-end React with server-side Express API routes  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to learn more about React hooks  
ðŸŒ± My first major project has been Opendoors - a MERN-stack project booking system for pupils in a school to book lunchtime slots at their in-house radio station.
